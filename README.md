AnimalTile is set up to take an animal prop (with id, imageUrl, name and description) and display the info in a card format.

There is an optional `clickHandler` prop which, when specified, executes the function passed using the animal id as a parameter. (This will be necessary for the logic in the Play component)

```js
function clickHandler(id){
  //some logic
}
